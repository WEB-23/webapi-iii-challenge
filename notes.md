1 - First I went to index.js and got the server listening on a port so I can make requests.
2 - Went into server.js to set up the logger function custom middleware
3 - wrote my get requests and then wrote the validateUserId middleware.
4 - Wrote the put, delete, posts. and then the validateUser and validatePost middlewares.
